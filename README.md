# Numbers 1 to 100 Web Application

This web application displays the numbers from 1 to 100 in a responsive grid layout. The application sets up a simple, clean interface where each number is rendered as an individual item within a flexible grid. 

## How it works
- When the page loads, JavaScript dynamically creates 100 div elements, each representing a number from 1 to 100.
- These elements are styled for clarity and responsiveness, adjusting to various screen sizes.
- The layout uses CSS Grid to ensure that the grid adapts to the viewport.

## Usage
- Simply open the HTML file in a web browser.
- The numbers will be automatically generated and displayed.

## Features
- Responsively adapts to different screen sizes.
- Clear and simple design, suitable for various use cases.
